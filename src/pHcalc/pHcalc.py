    Parameters
    ----------
    Ka : None (default), float, list, Numpy Array

    pKa : None (default), float, list, Numpy Array
        The pKa value(s) for all the acidic protons in this species.  This
        follows the same rules as Ka (See Ka description for more details),

    This class, a subclass of AcidAq, treats those acidic species that 
    exist in equilibrium with a gas-phase resevoir, which keeps the amount
    of dissolved gas (the neutral form) constant. 
    
    The main application of this species is to model the effect of atmospheric
    CO2 on the acid-base chemistry of the solution. Dissolved CO2(aq) exists 
    partially as carbonic     acid (H2CO3)* which then further dissociates into
    bicarbonate (HCO3-) and carbonate (CO3{2-}). This is favoured at high pH.
    
    *) CO2(aq) and H2CO3(aq) are treated as a single species and simply
       referred to as CO2(aq), whose concentration is kept constant, and which
       is in equilibrium with H+(aq) + HCO3-(aq)

    Parameters
    ----------

        See AcidAq.
    Hs : float
        Henry solubility of the species (in [M atm-1] or [M Pa-1], 
        depending on the units Pgas). For example, the value for CO2 in pure
        water at 298K is 0.03429 M atm-1, taken from ref. [1], Table II, 
        converted from molality to molarity, i.e. 0.997 * 10**-1.463
    Pgas : float
        The partial pressure of the species in the gas phase in [atm] or [Pa],
        in consistence with Hs. The partial pressure is considered constant,
        i.e. the gas phase is a reservoir of the species. For example, the
        average Pgas for CO2 in the ambient atmosphere is currently 417e-6 atm
        (it was 372e-6 atm in 1972). This value is rising over the years:
