    This class, a subclass of AcidAq, treats those acidic species that 
    exist in equilibrium with a gas-phase resevoir, which keeps the amount
    of dissolved gas (the neutral form) constant. 
    
    The main application of this species is to model the effect of atmospheric
    CO2 on the acid-base chemistry of the solution. Dissolved CO2(aq) exists 
    partially as carbonic     acid (H2CO3)* which then further dissociates into
    bicarbonate (HCO3-) and carbonate (CO3{2-}). This is favoured at high pH.
    
    *) CO2(aq) and H2CO3(aq) are treated as a single species and simply
       referred to as CO2(aq), whose concentration is kept constant, and which
       is in equilibrium with H+(aq) + HCO3-(aq)

    Hs : float

        water at 298K is 0.03429 M atm-1, taken from ref. [1], Table II, 
        converted from molality to molarity, i.e. 0.997 * 10**-1.463
    Pgas : float
        The partial pressure of the species in the gas phase in [atm] or [Pa],
        in consistence with Hs. The partial pressure is considered constant,
        i.e. the gas phase is a reservoir of the species. For example, the
        average Pgas for CO2 in the ambient atmosphere is currently 417e-6 atm
        (it was 372e-6 atm in 1972). This value is rising over the years:
